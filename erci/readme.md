#Expenditure Ratio per Capita Income ERCI

## Background
Many times you read a price quote of some service or item in a other country or region, converted into a currency you might be able to relate to, but generally you don't get a real connection to the price compared to your own situation.

## Idea
The idea with 'Expenditure Ratio per Capita Income' is to provide a number that can give the reader a ratio they can relate to.

Instead of writing: "cost of 1 liter of milk in Norway is 20 NOK" instead you would write: "cost of 1 liter mlik in Norway is 20 NOK (**0.05% ERCI-C**)".
